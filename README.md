# System/14
## What?
- A 'kernel' written in pure C.
- The aim is for it to one day become a functional workstation system.
- I believe in the simplicity of C in its pure form, which is why system14 is written in C and Assembly exclusively.

## Goals
- Compatibility with most real hardware.
- Being able to emulate a unix-like environment.
- Being advanced enough to the point where System/14 can self-host.

## Cross compilation
- It is recommended to use a cross compiler to compile System/14. I recommend using [crosstool-ng](https://crosstool-ng.github.io/) with a **bare metal** target with **no** libc.
